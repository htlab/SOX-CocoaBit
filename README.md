# SOX-CocoaBit

- This is a SOX sensor data posting implementation for "CocoaBit", an Arduino (+WiFi) module for LittleBits.
- For LittleBits, please refer http://littlebits.cc/ and http://jp.littlebits.com/
- For CocoaBit, please refer https://dotstud.io/blog/cocoabit-littlebits-milkcocoa-nefry/ and other web materials.
- By installing this software into a CocoaBit, you can post data on your own LittleBit combination to Sensor-Over-XMPP (SOX) network, by...
  - 1. Installing the software into your CocoaBit
  - 2. Physically attaching your CocoaBit into your LittleBits modules
  - 3. Configuring destination SOX server hostname, port, nodename, and transducer_id
     - Example hostname: sox.ht.sfc.keio.ac.jp
     - Example port: 5222
     - Example nodename: testNode_data
     - Example transducer_id: temperature
